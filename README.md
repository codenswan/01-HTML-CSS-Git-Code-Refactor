# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor

I changed generic elements in the html to appropriate semantic elements. 

I added a header with nav nested inside. 

The Main element included articles. I kept the ids so the links from the nav container would work on the page.

Instead of of divs I used article elements to organise the main container.

I used a section element to contain multiple aside elements to organise the right hand side of the page.

finally I added a footer element.

The CSS selectors were all changed from to the match appropriate elements. When I changed some elements, some of the corresponding CSS properties became redundant and so I tidied the CSS up a bit.

Alt descriptors were added to all images. I couldn't work out how to add an alt to the background image in the CSS.
